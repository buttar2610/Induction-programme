# My Induction Programme Experience @ GNDEC 2K25

# DAY 1
My first day at GNDEC started with a mix of excitement, nervousness, and a sense of entering a new phase of life. I typically experienced a blend of anticipation, curiosity about navigating a new environment, making friends, and handling the academic workload. The day often involves orientation sessions, meeting new classmates and professors, and getting acquainted with the campus and its resources.
